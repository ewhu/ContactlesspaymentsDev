**Contactless Payments Development Framework**
**Empowering Seamless, Secure, and Efficient Payment Experiences**

The Contactless Payments Development Framework is an open-source Python project designed to facilitate the development of innovative, contactless payment solutions. This framework provides a robust, modular, and scalable architecture for building secure, efficient, and user-friendly payment systems. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and industry standards, developers can quickly build and deploy contactless payment applications that cater to diverse use cases and industries.

The framework's primary objective is to bridge the gap between traditional payment systems and emerging technologies, such as near-field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and biometric authentication. By providing a unified development platform, the Contactless Payments Development Framework enables developers to focus on creating value-added services and features, rather than building payment infrastructure from scratch.

Some of the key benefits of using this framework include:

* Reduced development time and costs
* Improved security and compliance with industry standards
* Enhanced user experience and convenience
* Increased flexibility and customizability
* Support for multiple payment protocols and technologies

**Key Features:**

* Modular architecture with decoupled payment processing, authentication, and notification components
* Support for multiple payment protocols, including EMV, ISO/IEC 14443, and ISO/IEC 18092
* Integration with popular payment gateways, such as Stripe, PayPal, and Square
* Advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms, including biometric authentication and public key cryptography
* Real-time transaction processing and settlement
* Comprehensive logging and analytics capabilities
* Support for multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards, mobile wallets, and cryptocurrencies

**Technology Stack:**

* Python 3.8+
* Django 3.2+
* PostgreSQL 12+
* Redis 6+
* Stripe Payment Gateway
* PayPal Payment Gateway
* Square Payment Gateway
* OpenCV 4.5+ (for biometric authentication)

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ContactlesspaymentsDev.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure database settings: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

**Configuration:**

* Environment variables:
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for payment processing
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_STRIPE_API_KEY`: Stripe API key
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_PAYPAL_API_KEY`: PayPal API key
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_SQUARE_API_KEY`: Square API key
* Settings:
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_PAYMENT_GATEWAY`: Select payment gateway (stripe, paypal, square)
	+ `CONTACTLESS_PAYMENTS_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD`: Select authentication method (biometric, pin, password)

**Usage:**

The framework provides a comprehensive API for payment processing, authentication, and notification. Below is an example of initiating a payment transaction:
